Microservice Kubernetes Sample
=====================

This demo uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as Docker
environment. Kubernetes also support service discovery and load
balancing. An Apache httpd as a reverse proxy routes the calls to the
services.

This project creates a complete micro service demo system in Docker
containers. The services are implemented in Java using Spring and
Spring Cloud.

It uses three microservices:
- `Order` to process orders.
- `Customer` to handle customer data.
- `Catalog` to handle the items in the catalog.


Apache HTTP Load Balancer
------------------------

Apache HTTP is used to provide the web page of the demo at
port 8080. It also forwards HTTP requests to the microservices.

Apache HTTP is configured as a reverse proxy for this.
Load balancing is left to Kubernetes.

To configure this Apache HTTP needs to get all registered services from
Kubernetes. It just uses DNS for that.


Remarks on the Code
-------------------

The microservices are:

- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog) is the application to take care of items.
- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer) is responsible for customers.
- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-order](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-order) does order processing. It uses
  microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog and microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer.
  Hystrix is used for resilience.

The microservices use REST to communicate to each other.
See e.g. [CatalogClient](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-order/src/main/java/com/ewolff/microservice/order/clients/CatalogClient.java) .
The hostname is configurable to allow tests with stubs.
The default is `catalog` which works with Kubernetes.
Other microservices are found using Kubernetes built-in DNS.
Kubernetes does the load balancing on the IP level.

The microservices have a Java main application in `src/test/java` to
run them stand alone. `microservice-demo-order` uses a stub for the
other services then. 

In `microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer` and `microserivce-kubernetes-demo-catalog` they are used to verify the implemented
REST services.

Netflix Hystrix:
Netflix Hystrix provides circuit breaker capabilities to a service consumer. If a service doesnâ€™t respond (e.g. due to a timeout or a communication error), Hystrix can redirect the call to an internal fallback method in the service consumer. If a service repeatedly fails to respond, Hystrix will open the circuit and fast fail (i.e. call the internal fallback method without trying to call the service) on every subsequent call until the service is available again. To determine wether the service is available again Hystrix allow some requests to try out the service even if the circuit is open. Hystrix executes embedded within its service consumer.

Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications using cluster system. Kubernetes allow run the application anywhere, giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
